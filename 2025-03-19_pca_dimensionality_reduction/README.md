# PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques

This session covers Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in mathematical detail, touches on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and provides a demonstration of dimensionality reduction and generative machine learning using an Autoencoder.

## How to run

To run the Python code, you will need Python, VS Code, and Git Bash installed (as per [DHSC installation instructions](https://ca-dsfrontdoor-qa-uks-001.wittyground-c68b08ab.uksouth.azurecontainerapps.io/python_setup.html)).

Open Git Bash by right clicking inside the `2025-03-19_pca_dimensionality_reduction` directory in Windows File Explorer, and clicking "Git Bash".

Load the environment required for this project - this will give you access to all the required packages:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If prompted, hit `y`.

Run:

```
conda activate pca-dimensionality-reduction-env
```

The Python code should now run for you in VS Code (you may need to select the `pca-dimensionality-reduction-env` interpreter when prompted).
