# Tech Club

The Tech Club is a series of monthly sessions for members of the Statistics and Data Science teams about some technique in Data Science. Tech Club is characterised by its heavy focus on the underlying mathematics and theory behind the techniques being discussed.

This repository is for hosting any code used in the course of these sessions.

Individual sessions should be saved in folders of the form `YYYY-MM-DD_session_name`, and each should contain a detailed README of what is covered in the session, and how to install and run required packages or code. Within each folder, Python code should be stored in a `python/` folder, and R code in an `R/` folder. Session folders should contain any requirements in a `requirements.txt` file, along with setup instructions.

## QA Status

Quality assurance is not done per se on these sessions, but typically each session is reviewed by the people running it before pushing to the `main` branch. Materials will be pushed after the session has taken place.
